"Pub" is a Nostr-native account system designed 
to make running Lightning infrastructure for your friends/family/customers 
easier than previously thought possible.

 Being Nostr-native eliminates the complexity of configuring your node like a server by using commodity Nostr relays. 
These relays, unlike LNURL proxies, are trustless by nature of Nostr's own encryption spec (NIP44).

 Support for optional services are integrated into Pub for operators seeking backward compatibility with legacy LNURLs and Lightning Addresses.

 By solving the networking and programability hurdles, Pub provides Lightning with a 3rd Layer that enables node-runners and 
 Uncle Jims to more easily bring their personal network into Bitcoin's permissionless economy. In doing so, Pub runners 
 can keep the Lightning Network decentralized, with custodial scaling that is free of fiat rails, large banks, 
 and other forms of high-time-preference shitcoinery.
